The goal of this project is to make an interactive audio player with multible functionalities including a play button, add and store a song, delete songs, have multible playlists and the option to add a song to favourites. Then automatically create another representation of the DOM to store it.

It is made only with vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. No frameworks or librarie were used. Another goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental technology needed for web development

This was a group project so as a team we utilized Git for version control and worked together through mob coding. 

We designed the product in Figma and then developed it following the final design decicions. 

The team was very co-operative and clicked together like hot chocolate and icecream🍧.
